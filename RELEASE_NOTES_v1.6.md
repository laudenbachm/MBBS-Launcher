# MBBS Launcher v1.55 Release Notes

**Release Date:** February 18, 2026
**Version:** 1.55.0

## Overview

Version 1.55 delivers three significant improvements: a new App Manager window for real-time program monitoring, mandatory administrator privileges for proper Windows 10/11 operation, and automatic duplicate-instance detection for Auto Launch programs.

## What's New

### 🗂️ App Manager (Beta)

A new floating status window shows the live state of your BBS and all auto-launch programs without needing to keep the main launcher visible.

- Real-time status for each program: Running, Stopped, Pending launch, or Crashed
- Countdown display for programs that haven't launched yet
- Right-click any program to Launch Now, Cancel Launch, or Stop Application
- Auto-shows when BBS starts (configurable), draggable, always-on-top option
- Position is remembered between sessions
- Access anytime from the system tray right-click menu

### 🔒 Run as Administrator Required

MBBS Launcher now requires administrator privileges for proper operation on modern Windows versions.

**Why This Change?**

A user reported that the launcher did not work correctly on Windows 11 without administrator privileges. Running as administrator ensures:

- ✅ Proper process enumeration and management
- ✅ Ability to bring running BBS applications to foreground
- ✅ Windows startup integration functionality
- ✅ Full access to system-level APIs for process management
- ✅ Reliable operation on Windows 11 and future Windows versions

### 🔍 Auto Launch Duplicate Detection

Auto Launch programs are now checked against running system processes before being started. If a configured program is already running — whether it was launched by MBBS Launcher or started externally — it will be skipped rather than launching a second instance. Skipped launches are recorded in `audit.log`. Manual menu options (1–8) are not affected by this check.

### What You'll See on Launch

When you start MBBS Launcher v1.55, Windows will show a UAC prompt:

```
User Account Control
