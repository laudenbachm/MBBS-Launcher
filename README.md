## About

MBBS Launcher is a Windows application that provides easy access to tools and utilities for The Major BBS Version 10 sysops. Inspired by the classic DOS-era Major BBS launcher interface, this modern version brings the nostalgic feel of the original while adding contemporary features and usability.

## 🐛 Bug Disclosure

This was coded by a guy who Googles "how to exit vim" every single time. There WILL be bugs. There WILL be spelling mistakes. There WILL be profanity shouted at my monitor. You've been warned!

## Features

### Core Features

## System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows 7 or later, Windows Server 2012 or later
- **Architecture:** 32-bit (x86) - runs on both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows
- **.NET Runtime:** **None required!** (Self-contained build)
- **Disk Space:** ~65 MB

### 📦 About the File Size

**Why is v1.5 larger than v1.20?**

v1.5 is a **self-contained build** that includes the entire .NET 8.0 runtime embedded in the executable. This means:

- ✅ **Zero dependencies** - No .NET runtime installation required
- ✅ **Works on any Windows PC** - Even systems without .NET installed
- ✅ **Simpler installation** - Just download and run
- ✅ **Better compatibility** - Guaranteed to work regardless of system configuration

**File size comparison:**
- **v1.20:** 1.3 MB + 150 MB .NET 6.0 runtime (required separately) = **151 MB total**
- **v1.5:** 65 MB (everything included) = **65 MB total**

Even though the single file is larger, you're actually using **less disk space overall** and eliminating the need to install .NET separately!

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/laudenbachm/MBBS-Launcher/releases) page
2. Extract to a folder of your choice
3. Run `MBBS Launcher.exe`

**That's it!** No .NET runtime installation needed. All dependencies are included in the single executable.

## Antivirus False Positives

Some antivirus software may flag MBBS Launcher as suspicious due to legitimate behaviors that are common in system utilities:

- **Process enumeration** - Checking if BBS programs are already running
- **Window manipulation** - Bringing running programs to foreground
- **Launching executables** - Starting BBS utilities on your behalf
- **Startup integration** - Optional auto-launch at Windows startup

**This is a FALSE POSITIVE.** The application is completely safe and open source.

### What We're Doing About It

- The executable has been submitted to Microsoft Defender and other major AV vendors for whitelisting
- All source code is publicly available in this repository for review
- We are working on obtaining a code signing certificate to eliminate these warnings

### If Windows Defender Blocks or Deletes the File

**Windows Defender may quarantine this file.** To use MBBS Launcher, you need to add an exclusion:

1. Open **Windows Security** (search for it in Start menu)
2. Go to **Virus & threat protection** → **Manage settings**
3. Scroll down to **Exclusions** → Click **Add or remove exclusions**
4. Click **Add an exclusion** → **Folder**
5. Browse to and select the folder containing `MBBS Launcher.exe`
6. Click **Select Folder**

**Note:** This is safe to do because the application is open source and has been verified clean (VirusTotal: 2/70 detection rate, no major AV vendors flagged it).

### If Other Antivirus Software Flags It

1. **Review the source code** - All code is available in this repository
2. **Scan on VirusTotal** - Check the analysis: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/df63ec5c68374a8fcd753466d985d756072d0c9bb04542e7ce918a8f7fa30994
3. **Add an exception** - Add `MBBS Launcher.exe` to your antivirus exclusions
4. **Report as false positive** - Help us by reporting it to your AV vendor
